# Tag-INST-326
A team collaboration on a game that is played among friends by tagging, finding and hiding 
Tag-INST-326** is a simple, text-based game inspired by traditional tag games played in many African communities. The game simulates a chase between players on a grid. One player is “It” and must try to tag the other players before they escape or hide.
This game is being built from scratch using Python and only concepts we've learned in INST 326 so far. It’s a collaborative group project that reflects our shared childhood experiences and our goal of learning how to apply programming concepts to build something real.
